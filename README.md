### Project overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance and trends of movies from 2012 to 2016. By analyzing various aspects of the movie data, we seek to identify patterns, make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the industry's dynamics.
### Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is taken from here: [Movies dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitsinghaiml/movie-data2012-2016) </br>
Hollywood movies released between 2012-2016 including total movie budget and revenue generated by each movie. This dataset likely includes information such as movie titles, release dates, genres, directors, cast members, production budgets, box office revenues. Analyzing this dataset could provide insights into trends in the film industry during those years, such as popular genres, successful production strategies, the impact of directors or actors on box office performance.
### Tools
- Excel
- Pivot tables
- Power Query
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling errors, missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting. The resulting excel file ready for analysis can be downloaded here - [Download file](https://github.com/mariiakun/DataProject/blob/efb3d6a4eb40ac88a6df8053762cc429bc82c9ca/Movies%20Data%20Ready%20for%20Dashboard.xlsx)
### Questions answered
- Most profitable genres in this period of time

### Data Visualization
There are several filers on the dashboard, which allow to see the data per year, genre, director, or main actor, - or overall.
There are also two charts that range the genres by the box office revenue, and show the dependance of the box office revenue in the release date. Additional tables show top 5 movies by the box office revenue and by the budget, and top 5 actors by the box office revenue and by the total budget of the movies they starred in.
