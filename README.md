### Project overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance and trends of movies from 2012 to 2016. By analyzing various aspects of the movie data, we seek to identify patterns, make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the industry's dynamics.
### Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is taken from here: [Movies dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitsinghaiml/movie-data2012-2016) </br>
Hollywood movies released between 2012-2016 including total movie budget and revenue generated by each movie. This dataset likely includes information such as movie titles, release dates, genres, directors, cast members, production budgets, box office revenues. Analyzing this dataset could provide insights into trends in the film industry during those years, such as popular genres, successful production strategies, the impact of directors or actors on box office performance, and the correlation between budget and revenue.
